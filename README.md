# Awesome Vehicle Builder

This is the repository of the game AVB (Awesome Vehicle Builder).

It is heavily inspired by Stormworks but also by Screwdrivers, Scrap Mechanic, Minecraft and Trailmakers.

While building you should modify a few base block with functionality like dials and controls like buttons and switches.
